Add "Advanced Analysis" dialog box, include Dan's Neighbor Analysis

Add dialog for if load fails, or when load successful

pull CA behind buttons/text, but in front of panel, so that 4:3 monitors work with buttons/text

Make "2nd order" CA

Change EvN neighborhood to "hybrid," add real evN and eM.

IMPORTANT BUG Apply Number twice ruins things (places probability input fields too low) -- have a dialog pop up asking if you really want to reset the grid after initialization? ???

DONE Add "save as" for save functions
