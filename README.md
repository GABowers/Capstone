# Capstone
Repository for C# code for CA program

This is a Unity program. It can be run in the Unity editor by downloading all files to a designated folder, then opening the Unity editor, selecting "Open Project," and selecting the designated folder. The library folder should be created automatically.

Note: this program was created in Unity 5.6.0f3. As far as I know you can't revert to an older version when running newer projects.

Big, BIG thanks to Dan Foose for all of his help with this--both with the program, and getting the github page online.
