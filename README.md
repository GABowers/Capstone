# Capstone
Repository for C# code for CA program

This is a Unity program. It can be run in the Unity editor by downloading all files to a designated folder, then opening the Unity editor, selecting "Open Project," and selecting the designated folder. The library folder should be created automatically.

Big, BIG thanks to Dan Foose for all of his help with this--both with the program, and getting the github page online.
